# Web Application Vulnerability Remediation 

This repository contains the code of a simple web application in JavaScript and HTML. The purpose of this project is to identify and remediate common security vulnerabilities following the OWASP Top Ten guidelines.

##  Description

Analyze the code of a simple web application in JavaScript and HTML to identify and remediate common security vulnerabilities, following the OWASP Top Ten.

## Instructions

1. **Repository Setup**:
    - Create your work repository.
    - Create the `develop` branch from the `main` branch.

2. **Branching Strategy**:
    - For each vulnerability found, create a new branch 
    - Perform the remediation on the respective branch.
    - Commit your changes with clear and descriptive messages.
    - Merge the changes back into the `develop` branch.
    - Once all vulnerabilities are remediated and merged into `develop`, merge `develop` into `main`.

3. **Documentation**:
    - Maintain this README file in the `main` branch.
    - For each vulnerability, provide an explanation on how you managed to remedy it.

## Workflow Summary

- Created the `develop` branch from the `main` branch.
- For each vulnerability, created a new feature branch, remediated the issue, committed the changes, and merged back into `develop`.
- After all remediations, merged `develop` into `main`.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the identification and remediation of common security vulnerabilities in a web application. By following the OWASP Top Ten guidelines, we enhanced the security posture of the application, making it more resilient against various types of attacks.
