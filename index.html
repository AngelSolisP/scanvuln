1. Use of localStorage to store credentials


localStorage.setItem('username', username);
localStorage.setItem('password', password);

//Vulnerability:

Storing credentials in localStorage is extremely insecure, as anyone with access to the browser can view these 
credentials through the developer console.
Remediation:

Never store credentials in localStorage. Use secure authentication and storage mechanisms, 
such as session tokens that are managed on the server and stored securely in cookies with HttpOnly and Secure flags.
