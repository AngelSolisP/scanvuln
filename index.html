2. Insecure credential validation in the frontend

if (username === 'admin' && password === 'admin123') {
    alert('Login successful!');
  } else {
    alert('Invalid credentials!');
  }
  

//Vulnerability:

Credential validation is performed on the frontend, allowing anyone to inspect the code and discover the credentials.
Remediation:

Perform credential validation on the backend. 
The frontend should send the credentials to the server, which handles validation and session management.
