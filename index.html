4. HTML injection without escaping

document.body.innerHTML += `<p>Welcome, ${username}!</p>`;

Vulnerability:

Injecting HTML without escaping can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. If username contains malicious code, it will execute in the browser.
Remediation:

Escape any user input before inserting it into the DOM. Use safe methods to manipulate the DOM, such as textContent:

const welcomeMessage = document.createElement('p');
welcomeMessage.textContent = `Welcome, ${username}!`;
document.body.appendChild(welcomeMessage);
